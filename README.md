### 👋 Olá! Tudo bem?

Hi, my name is **Rodrigo de Sousa** and currently I'm studying to be a Front-end Developer. I've got a lot to learn so the road is still long.

### 🕺 About me
I'm a Bachelor in Computer Science that likes to read novels online in my leisure time. Love to eat jujubas and put pepper all over my food. I like to work in groups and I'm mostly self taught in the languages I know.

###  🛣️ What have I been doing...
* Refactoring a private project in Laravel.
* Learned VueJS
* Looking into React
* Preparing to make my Web Portfolio
* Missing the time I painted
